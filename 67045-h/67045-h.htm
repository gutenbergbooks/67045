<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1831 the Asiatic Cholera first
made its appearance in this country.&nbsp; It spread
consternation wherever it went.&nbsp; This pestilence, however,
had its mission.&nbsp; It had previously swept over the fairest
portions of the earth, and had destroyed no less than fifty
millions of human beings.&nbsp; Its birth-place was among the
swamps and jungles of India.&nbsp; True to its origin, it
principally revelled in the crowded and neglected districts of
our large towns, and gathered its victims from the homes of the
poor and indigent.&nbsp; It sought out the abodes of filth and
fever&mdash;it flew from one reeking nest of disease to
another.&nbsp; The public authorities were startled into
exertion; whitewash and soap were in requisition&mdash;a
visitation of the alleys and lanes commenced&mdash;and, in many
instances, the accumulated filth and rubbish of years were
removed.&nbsp; A great many temporary expedients, all excellent
in their way, were adopted.&nbsp; One unquestionable good was the
result of these extraordinary measures&mdash;the higher classes
obtained a glimpse of the condition of their poorer brethren.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The
cholera at length passed away, and our exertions died with
it.&nbsp; The stern teacher went to other lands, and we relapsed
into our wonted carelessness, our usual indifference&mdash;we
became easy and comfortable again.&nbsp; It is true we have had
several official inquiries, and through their means much
information has been elicited and diffused.&nbsp; Some
improvements have been effected, and others are in progress, but
nothing has been done commensurate to the requirements of the
case.&nbsp; Our towns exhibit the same grievous defects.&nbsp;
There is, as yet, no complete system of drainage and
sewerage&mdash;our dwellings are in the same condition as to air
and light, and other conveniences&mdash;and a supply of water is
still a desideratum.&nbsp; The old fever-nests remain.&nbsp; We
have a vast number of abominations in every direction inviting
pestilence, and scattering abroad the seeds of disease, misery,
and demoralisation.&nbsp; It is true we have obtained a Health
Bill, but it is quite clear that the establishment of a central
authority can do little, without the sympathy and co-operation of
the public at large.</p>
<p>In this state of things, we have another visitation of the
Asiatic cholera.&nbsp; We are again admonished as to our duties
as men and Christians.&nbsp; Once more we are awakened to a full
knowledge of the fact, that thousands of our fellow creatures are
perishing annually, <i>victims to public neglect</i>.&nbsp; The
great bulk of our working classes are placed in a condition
unfavourable to health&mdash;a condition that forbids the
preservation of the ordinary decencies and moralities of
life.&nbsp; <i>There is a responsibility rests upon all who have
influence or power</i>&mdash;<i>a responsibility which cannot be
shaken off</i>.&nbsp; The work of reform is not accomplished
because we have got a legislative enactment and a Board of
Health.&nbsp; Every town-council and all parish authorities must
see to it that the present warning is not neglected, and that it
is not permitted to pass away unimproved.&nbsp; It is a question
involving many others of great moment; and experience has <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>shown that they
cannot be neglected without serious loss, nor without entailing
upon us great physical and moral evils.</p>
<p>The history of the present visitation will be familiar to all
readers.&nbsp; The general statements are absolutely
appalling.&nbsp; In Albion Terrace, Wandsworth Road, seventeen
persons died within a fortnight, in ten houses, of cholera.&nbsp;
In one house no less than six persons died.&nbsp; This house was
occupied by the Rev. Mr. Harrison, a dissenting minister: he had
two relatives staying with him,&mdash;Mrs. Roscoe and Mrs.
Edwards.&nbsp; Mrs. Roscoe was first attacked, and died; Mrs.
Edwards, who attended upon her, was next seized; and on Mr.
Harrison returning from the funeral of Mrs. Roscoe, he found his
wife attacked by the same disease, and that lady expired the next
morning.&nbsp; Mr. Harrison, overwhelmed by this terrible
calamity, fled to Hampstead.&nbsp; On the morning of his
departure Mrs. Edwards died, and the cook was attacked and died
the same evening.&nbsp; On the following day the three bodies
were interred at Kensall Green; and on the return of the mourners
they found the nurse who had attended Mrs. Edwards dead, and a
note informed them that Mr. Harrison had been attacked at
Hampstead, and had died the same day.&nbsp; It is important to
look at some of the facts brought out before the coroner&rsquo;s
jury.&nbsp; Mr. Harrison had stated before his death that he
believed the attack had arisen from <i>bad drainage and from bad
water</i>.&nbsp; Dr. Milroy stated, in his report, that in the
house in which the epidemic had first broken out in that
neighbourhood,&mdash;&ldquo;The cellars were swarming with filth
and maggots, amounting altogether to some
cart-loads.&rdquo;&nbsp; The verdict of the jury declared that
the disease had first broken out &ldquo;in a house where the
drainage was very defective, and the water bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other places we find the same causes actively at work,
producing cholera.&nbsp; The seizures have been mainly in the
districts notorious for bad sanitary arrangements.&nbsp; In every
case we find that the track of cholera has been <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>identical with
that of fever.&nbsp; In a report just published by the Board of
Health ample evidence is supplied that the seats of fever are
also the seats of cholera.</p>
<p>The first decided case in London occurred in a court that had
been specially pointed out to the Sanitary Commissioners.&nbsp;
In the town of Uxbridge four cases occurred last October, marked
by the unequivocal characteristics of Asiatic cholera.&nbsp; One
of the persons lived in a house notoriously insalubrious, and in
which some cases of malignant fever had proved fatal.&nbsp; In
relation to it the medical man had said, that if ever cholera
visited Uxbridge, he believed the first case would be in that
house.&nbsp; The conditions upon which cholera extends are
everywhere the same.&nbsp; They establish most clearly the
connection between a low sanitary condition and
disease,&mdash;between filth and fever; and show that the two
diseases, although rarely, if ever, found in the same district
together, are twins from the same parent stock.&nbsp; They have,
no doubt, a common origin.</p>
<p>One word on the attacks of typhus.&nbsp; How is it that we are
stirred into activity by an invasion of cholera? that we feel so
much alarm?&nbsp; It is proved that the mortality from attacks of
cholera, during its visitation in 1831&ndash;2, was not greater
altogether than the average annual mortality occasioned by
typhus.&nbsp; The effects of the latter disease are still more
serious than those of cholera.&nbsp; And yet we sit down with the
latter, and become reconciled to its existence, <i>because it is
common and always with us</i>.&nbsp; If the sanitary evils which
have been proved to exist almost universally were removed,
cholera and typhus would scarcely be known amongst us; and yet
&ldquo;the annual slaughter in England and Wales, <i>from
preventable causes of typhus</i>, which attacks persons in the
vigour of life, appears to be double the amount of what was
suffered by the allied armies in the battle of
Waterloo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every day, disease and death arise from
the presence of <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>filth, from bad water, or overcrowding.&nbsp; They are
put down in the bills of mortality as deaths by typhus,
scarlatina, consumption, &amp;c.&mdash;the true report would be,
<i>poisoned by bad air</i>, <i>killed by public
neglect</i>.&nbsp; It would not be too much to say that they are
sacrificed to the indolence, incapacity, or waywardness of the
public authorities.</p>
<p>To justify this view of the case, I may quote, from the report
just referred to, a passage in relation to Dumfries.&nbsp; This
town had suffered most severely in 1832.&nbsp; I believe at that
time the cholera attacked one-eleventh of the entire population,
and destroyed one-seventeenth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing,&rdquo; say the Commissioners, &ldquo;that
little sanitary improvement had been effected in the interval,
and consequently that the inhabitants must be in as great danger
as before, we called the attention of the authorities to the
special regulations of the Board.&nbsp; To our recommendations
the parochial board paid no regard.&nbsp; The disease, meantime,
went on committing its former ravages.&nbsp; Thus, within the
first twenty-nine days after its outbreak, there occurred 269
deaths out of a population of 10,000.&nbsp; No efforts being made
on the part of the local authorities to check this great
mortality, it appeared to us that this was a case requiring a
stringent enforcement of the regulations of the Board, and we
sent one of our medical inspectors (Dr. Sutherland) to organise a
plan of house-to-house visitation, to open dispensaries for
affording medical assistance by night as well as by day, and to
provide houses of refuge for the temporary reception of persons
living in filthy and overcrowded rooms, where the disease was
prevailing, and who, though not yet attacked, were likely to be
the next victims.&nbsp; The result of the adoption of these
measures was, that, on the second day after they were brought
into operation, the attacks fell from 27, 38, and 23 daily, to
11; on the fifth day they diminished to eight; on the ninth day
no new case occurred, and <i>in another week the disease nearly
disappeared</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Surely,
there was great want of knowledge or culpable neglect, on the
part of the local authorities, in this case.&nbsp; In other cases
similar conduct has been displayed.&nbsp; It appears we have yet
to learn that the care of the public health is a branch of social
economics; that it involves more than mere pecuniary
considerations.&nbsp; We have not summed up the evils of this
immense pressure of disease when we have estimated the number of
those attacked, or the number of those who die.&nbsp; The money
cost, though heavy, is a mere trifle to the various afflictions
that follow in the dark train.&nbsp; Neither does the bodily
suffering&mdash;the physical pain&mdash;complete the amount of
evil.&nbsp; The more we look at it, the more intense does the
feeling of awe and sorrow become.&nbsp; We find, as we look
abroad on the face of society, a fearful retribution for sins of
neglect, and for opportunities unemployed.&nbsp; We find ample
proof that the ordinations of Divine Providence cannot be
violated with impunity:&mdash;if we sever the links of duty and
of kindness which unite us to our fellow-men, we cannot separate
ourselves from the guilt, the suffering, and the loss, such
alienation may induce.</p>
<p>I must present some of these evils in detail.&nbsp; I begin
with the lowest&mdash;the pecuniary loss.&nbsp; We have to
estimate the unnecessary deaths, the unnecessary sickness, the
number of funerals, the burthens upon every charity, and that
upon the poor-rate.&nbsp; <i>The fever-tax is the heaviest of all
taxes</i>.&nbsp; And yet a much larger sum is annually spent in
sustaining a number of palliative expedients, than would suffice
to support a machinery of prevention.&nbsp; It is laid upon us,
sometimes by the neglect, sometimes by the false economy of local
authorities.&nbsp; They have only one object&mdash;to keep down
the rates.&nbsp; However obvious the improvement, it is met by
the question&mdash;&ldquo;How much will it cost?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Short-sighted economy!&nbsp; The question ought to
be&mdash;&ldquo;How much suffering and sickness will it
prevent?&rdquo;&nbsp; The largest sum that could by possibility
be required to carry out all the <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>needful schemes of sanitary
improvement, are far exceeded by the sums now expended in various
ways, and which are entailed upon us by the presence of disease,
and the poverty it produces.</p>
<p>The moral evils far exceed any pecuniary loss, and outweigh
any amount of physical suffering.&nbsp; The various epidemic
diseases generally attack persons in the vigour of life.&nbsp;
This is, especially, the case with typhus, which is, as Dr. Guy
terms it, our &ldquo;pet epidemic,&rdquo; and which we nurse
&ldquo;with as much care as if we loved it.&rdquo;&nbsp; How many
widows and orphans are thus thrown destitute upon the
world?&nbsp; How many thousands of poor children are cast,
homeless and friendless, upon the streets, furnishing supplies
for that great fund of juvenile depravity of which we have lately
heard so much?&nbsp; These wretched children crowd our
thoroughfares, miserable and abject.&nbsp; They soon acquire the
irregular habits of the class among whom they are thrown.&nbsp;
Let the candid mind calculate the cost.&nbsp; How much in
poor-rates? how much in alms? how much to public
institutions?&nbsp; And then let us ask how many of them become
depredators and thieves&mdash;punishing society for its
neglect&mdash;punishing, by preying upon its
property&mdash;punishing, by spreading abroad the contagion of
disease and of vice&mdash;and punishing, by the cost of prisons,
police, bridewells, penitentiaries, and all the other appliances
to repress crime?&nbsp; The reports from some places are of the
most painful description, as respects the great number of orphans
made by the present visitation of cholera.&nbsp; If this applies
to an occasional visit of cholera, it applies with ten-fold force
to typhus.&nbsp; I know, at this moment, three different families
suffering under this affliction.&nbsp; In two of the cases, the
mother is left to struggle with a large family; in the other
case, both parents were taken off by fever within a fortnight of
each other.&nbsp; The children are in the workhouse.</p>
<p>Look at it in another light, as depriving the poor man of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the ability to
toil.&nbsp; Health is the working man&rsquo;s all&mdash;his
capital&mdash;his stock-in-trade.&nbsp; Deprived of it, his means
of subsistence are gone&mdash;his independence is
destroyed.&nbsp; His sole possessions are his skill and
industry.&nbsp; It is considered unjust to deprive him of free
markets and fair play.&nbsp; Is it not cruel to surround him by
such circumstances as greatly increase the chances of
sickness?&nbsp; Have we never known a sober, industrious man
stricken down by an attack of fever, and rising from his bed of
sickness to look upon a prospect of poverty and want?&nbsp; His
means have become exhausted&mdash;he has run into debt, and that
debt clogs his future energies.&nbsp; Perhaps the fever leaves
him in broken health and infirmity.&nbsp; He struggles awhile
with all these adverse circumstances; seeks parish relief, and
declines into pauper habits.&nbsp; The workman has a right, by
every law divine and human, to eat his daily bread by his daily
toil.&nbsp; Is it not a mockery to allow him this, if the
conditions of health are withheld?&nbsp; Is it not worse?&nbsp;
Is it not injustice to leave him in a condition inferior to the
criminal?&nbsp; The man who has offended the laws can enjoy all
the luxuries of good air, good water, and live in a palace, as
compared with the wretched hovels in which thousands of our
working men, with their wives and families, are placed.&nbsp; Are
we always to go on discussing plans of prison discipline, and the
efficacy of various kinds of treatment for paupers?&nbsp; Are we
never to learn that <i>the true philosophy is to inquire by what
means we can prevent those who are not yet paupers or criminals
from becoming so</i>?&nbsp; Sanitary reform is only one means,
but it is one of primary importance.&nbsp; How can we expect to
cultivate habits of temperance and industry&mdash;how can we hope
to diffuse the blessings of education, so indispensable to the
elevation of the people in morals and happiness, so long as they
are left physically degraded and wretched?&nbsp; The soil is
unfavourable to the reception of religious counsel and
consolation.&nbsp; This lesson must be learnt before we can hope
to legislate wisely.&nbsp; All <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>practical remedies must begin by a due
care for the material wants of the population.</p>
<p>It is not possible, in the compass of a tract, to enter into
detail on all the evils of our present condition.&nbsp; They are
too general to have escaped the attention of any careful
observer.&nbsp; With regard to drainage and sewerage, every town
in the kingdom is defective.&nbsp; Nearly all are equally so with
regard to supplies of water; and the overcrowding in wretchedly
constructed dwellings has become matter of universal
complaint.&nbsp; The people have no control over the construction
of their dwellings, little or none over the selection, as they
must be near their place of work.&nbsp; They have to pay a high
price for the most wretched accommodation.&nbsp; The state of
living is utterly at variance with cleanliness, order, or the
cultivation of decent habits.&nbsp; Labouring under these
disadvantages, they have a right to demand of the higher classes
a complete system of drainage and sewerage, an efficient water
supply, and a thorough cleansing of streets&mdash;no penny wise
and pound foolish policy ought to stand in the way.&nbsp; They
have a right to demand such reforms as will make their homes the
abode of comfort to their families.&nbsp; It is injustice, it is
cruelty to withhold them.&nbsp; How is it that, in the active
discussion of public and private rights, at present going on,
there are so few to vindicate the poor man&rsquo;s claims to pure
air and good water?</p>
<p>I would remind those who are in affluence and comfort of the
duties of their station.&nbsp; Many of them can go away from the
crowded streets, and spend the greater part of their time in a
suburban residence; not so the poor man.&nbsp; The rich man can
command many comforts beyond the reach of the poor man.&nbsp; He
has to work, perhaps, in a heated, crowded workshop, and to
retire to a room wretchedly small, and unwholesome.&nbsp; Need we
wonder that he should sometimes prefer the gin-shop, or the
beer-house, to his own dim, close, and dirty apartment?&nbsp; I
make no <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>apology for his excesses.&nbsp; I do not wish to excuse
his faults.&nbsp; But I ask whether many of the errors, so
conspicuous in the character of the poorer population, may not
have arisen from the neglect of those who had the power to
stimulate them to higher and better things?&nbsp; Before we
reproach them with the neglect of their duties, let us see that
our own are faithfully discharged.&nbsp; If we want to raise them
up, we must begin by doing them justice.&nbsp; Remove the
acknowledged evils that press so heavily upon their condition,
and the assurance awaits us that the Almighty, who rewards all
cheerful and honest labour, will bless the effort to the good of
those who give and to those who may receive.</p>
<p>All delay is dangerous, and not only so, it is criminal.&nbsp;
The evils of which we complain have been allowed to remain from a
general ignorance of the laws of health.&nbsp; Up to a recent
period, there was a want of knowledge amongst even the educated
classes on these vital subjects.&nbsp; We cannot offer that plea
now, to excuse our indifference or neglect.&nbsp; The evils have
been fully explored, and most clearly exposed.&nbsp; The
connexion between filth and disease&mdash;the suffering and vice
flowing from them, have been exhibited in so striking a manner as
to leave no room for mistake or misapprehension.&nbsp; <i>The
knowledge creates a solemn responsibility</i>, <i>and makes us
really chargeable with the consequences</i>.&nbsp; The knowledge
gives us the power to arrest the progress of a class of diseases
which strike down so many of our fellow-creatures in the years of
their strength and usefulness.&nbsp; Every day of supineness is
so much opportunity wasted.&nbsp; Every delay carries death to
thousands.&nbsp; The admonition now read to us must not be
suffered to pass with our usual heedlessness, or we may perchance
be aroused by still more fearful means.</p>
<p>The poor man is now sufficiently instructed to feel that many
of the evils of which he complains admit of removal, and that the
wealthier classes have the power to effect a <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>change that
would surround his condition with many comforts.&nbsp; Is there
no danger in leaving such a feeling to grow and develop itself
among the working classes?&nbsp; The security of the State
depends upon the feelings of the people at large.&nbsp; What hold
can there be upon their sympathies or affections, if they are
left to themselves; to all the misery of their present lot, and
with the knowledge, too, that those who have the power to help,
though witnesses of their suffering and sorrow, like the priest
and the Levite, turn away, and pass on the other side.&nbsp; We
can expect no other fruit than alienation and disaffection.&nbsp;
We shall see it manifested in contempt of the laws; in bitterness
of feeling to the property classes; in an increasing disregard to
the invitations of religion; in still greater recklessness of
conduct, and still more irregular habits.&nbsp; Have the
revolutions of 1848 been read to us in vain?&nbsp; What was there
behind these mighty convulsions?&nbsp; Simply this:&mdash;The
people had been little regarded; their appeals had met with no
attention; their wants were neglected; their wrongs were left
unredressed; government did not seem to secure or care for their
prosperity and happiness.&nbsp; Tumult and disorder were the
inevitable results.&nbsp; It is a law of God that men shall reap
as they have sown.&nbsp; In this land we have, under Providence,
secured some of the blessings of good government, and in
consequence a hardy and industrious race has sprung up.&nbsp; It
is in the power of the richer classes to gather round the
institutions of the country the affections of the people at
large.&nbsp; They may do much to banish the grim forms of disease
and want which now threaten the poor man&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; They
can carry light to his darkened abode, and dispense comfort and
joy upon his gloomy hearth.&nbsp; By timely effort they may raise
up a young generation, who will cherish the home attachments, pay
ready obedience to the laws, and, by habits of sobriety and
cheerful industry, give strength and stability to the
State.&nbsp; They may, by a proper discharge of the duties of
their <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>stewardship, in a few years, cover the land with smiling
homes and a contented population.&nbsp; And then, again, there is
the converse of this.&nbsp; They may, by neglect and
indifference, by leaving the people in their present condition,
prepare the way for a state of things that every generous mind
would tremble to contemplate.&nbsp; Who is there so blind as not
to see in one course security and happiness; in the other,
wretchedness and peril?&nbsp; I hope there is no need to urge the
propriety, the necessity of the former course.&nbsp; I trust that
all classes will unite to secure the true glory of
England&mdash;that of raising up a healthy and happy
population.&nbsp; Science can have no higher aim; government no
loftier purpose; philanthropy no holier pursuit.&nbsp; It is not
less our interest than a duty enjoined upon us by the principles
of our holy religion, to administer to the necessities of the
lowly and distressed.&nbsp; Let us, while it is yet day,
&ldquo;break off our sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by
showing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of our
tranquillity.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The following extract
is from the Report of Mr. Phillips, Surveyor Metropolitan Sewers
Commission:&mdash;&ldquo;At the last census, in 1841, there were
270,859 houses in the metropolis.&nbsp; It is known that there is
scarcely a house without a cesspool under it, and that a large
number have two, three, four, and more under them, so that the
number of such receptacles in the metropolis may be taken at
300,000.&nbsp; The exposed surface of each cesspool measures, on
an average, 9 feet, and the mean depth of the whole is about
6&frac12; feet; so that each contains 58&frac12; cubic feet of
fermenting filth, of the most poisonous, noisome, and disgusting
nature.&nbsp; The exhaling surface of all the cesspools (300,000
&times; 9) = 2,700,000 feet, or equal to 62 acres nearly: and the
total quantity of foul matter contained within them (300,000
&times; 58&frac12;) = 17,550,000 cubic feet, or equal to one
enormous elongated stagnant cesspool, 50 feet in width, 6 feet 6
in. in depth, and extending through London, from the Broadway at
Hammersmith to Bow-bridge, a length of ten miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; say the Metropolitan Sanitary
Commissioners, &ldquo;there is reason to believe, is an under
estimate.&nbsp; The cesspool, however, in general, forms but
one-fourth of the evaporating surface&mdash;the house-drain forms
half or two-fourths, and the sewer one; but, connected as the
sewers and house drains mutually are, and acted upon by the winds
and barometric conditions, the miasma from the house-drains and
sewers of one district may be carried up to another.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
